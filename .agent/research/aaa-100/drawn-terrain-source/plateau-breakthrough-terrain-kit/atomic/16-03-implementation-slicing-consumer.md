# Implementation Slicing Consumer

Status: active docs-only
Atom: 16-03
Family: implementation-slicing
Layer: consumer
Domain: production

## Purpose

Runtime work must start with a tiny fixture and stop before broad replacement when source consumers diverge.

This atom exists to name the downstream kits that must consume this family.

## Required Output

- Name the owning generic and GoldRush kit.
- Name the source field or derived descriptor.
- Name the consumer that must not invent its own copy.
- Name the proof that prevents fake resolution.

## Data Boundary

Keep config minimal. Source facts come from the drawn terrain revision. Derived facts must carry provenance back to that revision.

## Player-View Acceptance

A player should be able to see or feel this atom through terrain readability, route confidence, object grounding, combat fairness, cashout clarity, or stable movement proof.

## Stop Condition

Do not mark this atom resolved until source data, consumer wiring, and human-view or simulator proof all agree on the same revision.
